# Search-Algorithms

mazes.zip contains the mazes images and their .txt versions.

main.py reads problem.txt:

By lines:
0. Size of the maze N - integer
1. Start state xy - two integers: 0 ≤ x, y < N
2. Goal state xy - two integers: 0 ≤ x, y < N
3. Algorithm - integer from 0 to 4
4. Maze - integer representing the maze to use

Maze.py contains the graph struct and the bfs, dls, and heuristic search algorithms.
